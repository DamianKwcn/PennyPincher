## Project Description

PennyPincher is a local web application designed for personal finance management and expense sharing among friends. It addresses the common challenge of splitting expenses during vacations, outings, and other social activities with friends, making it easy to track and settle shared expenses.

## Technologies Used

PennyPincher is built using the following technologies:

- **Java 17**: The programming language used for backend development.
- **Spring Boot 3.1.4**: Provides a robust framework for building web applications and RESTful services.
- **Spring Data REST WebMVC**: Simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs for data access and manipulation.
- **Spring Security**: Ensures secure authentication and authorization within the application.
- **Hibernate**: Provides object-relational mapping (ORM) for seamless interaction with Java objects, often used in conjunction with JPA.
- **JDBC**: Enables direct interaction with the database through the execution of SQL queries.
- **Thymeleaf**: A modern server-side Java template engine for web applications.
- **Lombok**: Simplifies Java code by providing annotations to reduce boilerplate code.
- **MySQL**: A relational database used for storing data in the application.

## Challenges Faced

During the development of PennyPincher, I encountered several challenges, including:

- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Implementing secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data.
- **Object-Relational Mapping**: Overcoming difficulties with object-relational mapping to ensure seamless interaction between Java objects and the relational database, especially while creating split and custom expenses.

## In the Future

I plan to implement the following features to enhance PennyPincher:

- **Real-Time Expense Sharing**: Enable real-time expense sharing and splitting among participants during events or outings.
- **Data Visualization**: Introduce data visualization tools to help users analyze their spending habits and financial trends.
- **Enhanced Expense Creation**: Provide users with more options and flexibility when creating expenses, allowing for detailed customization.
